  <p>I am senior in high school, taking duel credit classes at Bob Jones University. I work at Hidden Treasure Christian School, which is a special needs school connected to Faith Baptist Church of Taylors, SC.<p>
<p>I am currently engrossed in school and work and all that comes with that (including not having any “spare” time). But when I do have time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, hiking, and writing/playing music on the piano. I plan on going into the transportation industry.<p>
